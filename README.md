## Overview
The Autonomous Driving Competition (ADC) of the [Portuguese Robotics Open](https://web.fe.up.pt/~robotica2019/index.php/en/) (PRO) represents a medium complexity technical challenge in which a mobile robot completely devoid of human input during its runtime travels in a track (with a size of ~17x7m), Fig. 1, detects and identifies signalling panels projected in two ordinary monitors, recognizes traffic signs defined in the [competition ruling](https://web.fe.up.pt/~robotica2019/images/fnr2019_Autonomous_Driving.pdf), detects and avoids obstacles and is able to park in two different parking areas.

To overcome the need physical space to develop and deploy the code on the real robot, a simulator was created. Currently this simulator supports two different robots. The first one, named Conde, uses a differential driving steering locomotion (two small wheels coupled in two motors that controls its linear and angular movement) and a castor wheel to balance the structure. The sensors applied to the robot are three cameras. Two pointed down to see/navigate along the track and detect/avoid obstacles and one pointed up to detect/identify the signaling panels and traffic signs.

The second one, called Major Alvega uses a ackermann steering locomotion and two cameras as sensors (as in the Conde robot one of the cameras is pointed up to see the track and the other is pointed up to see the signalling panels and traffic signs). 

These two robots represent real world robots as shown in Fig. 2.

This simulator is able to replicate all of the autonomous driving competition challenges of the PRO.
